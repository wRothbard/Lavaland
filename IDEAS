traders not take dirt/cobble, maybe gold only.
maybe a shop keeper that only does gold instead?
npcs for character quests/'taming'

check for locked chests/doors in order to claim an area.

protected backpack?

bones breaking on punch for new players is such a different
behavior than they're used to.  i've been tempted to return
behavior to punch to take inventory, but i really don't want
to.  the behavior is that the bones are never protected,
that they're dangerous for the player and their items.  I fear
that if I make them punch-to-collect items, next I'll need
to make them protected, as they are in other games!

how to make, farm dirt better?  right now you have to have cobble
near water.  another option is a quick recipe.  but ideally,
i think, i will add machines for making dirt/gravel/sand!
