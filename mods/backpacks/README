Leather bag crafted with eight leather.
Colored wool backpacks crafted with eight wool.

Backpacks can be renamed.  Placing a backpack on the craftgrid and
obtaining the two leather output results in the contents of the backpack
spewing around the player.

Backpacks must be placed on the ground, and will fall if their supporting
node is removed.
