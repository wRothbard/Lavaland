The server was up for about a week, and I noticed new users were getting
increased stats, level 6, stam 30, etc..  I couldn't reproduce it locally,
and when restarting the server it was gone, the stats were correct!  Weird!

Does the cauldron make sounds only when you right click it with water?
What about server reboot?

Some sounds are missing
